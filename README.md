# Getting Started

Have you ever felt like you don't know what's happening in your GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repositories? Between 100s or 1000s of them it's hard to make sure every single one is compliant to certain security and best practices guidelines.

Reposaur is here to fix that, empowering you to focus on your work instead of hunting for issues and misconfigurations. 

## Features

- Custom policies using the [Rego][rego] policy language ([learn more][docs-policy])
- A simple, composable and easy-to-use CLI ([learn more][docs-cli])
- Extendable using a straightforward SDK (written in Go)
- Reports follow the standard SARIF format, enabling easy integrations with different systems
- Policies can be unit tested, guaranteeing they work as expected
- Integration with the major development platforms (see [Integrations](#integrations))
- Easily integrate new platforms using the SDK

## Guides

- [Writing your first policy](https://docs.reposaur.com/guides/writing-your-first-policy)
